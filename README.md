# Blockchain-Based-E-voting
The objective of this project is to develop a blockchain-based e-voting system using the Solidity programming language, Truffle CLI, Ganache CLI, and Metamask. This system will provide a secure, transparent, and efficient way for citizens to cast their votes electronically, eliminating the need for traditional paper-based voting systems.
